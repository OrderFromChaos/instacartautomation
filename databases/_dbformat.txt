Recipe data is input through recipedata.txt, 
    as the format is more convenient for human input.
An example of the format is as follows:
    Easy Egg Fried Rice|4tbsp peanut oil,2tbsp garlic,2tbsp ginger,1 sweet onion,4cups rice,4 eggs,2tsp sesame oil,4tsp soy sauce,pinch salt,pinch black pepper 
    Easy Chicken Congee with Peanuts|5cups chicken broth,1cups rice,2cups chicken,pinch salt,pinch soy sauce,pinch sesame oil,pinch scallions,pinch cilantro,pinch peanuts,pinch chili oil
In specific:
    <recipe name>|<quantity><qtype> <ingredient name>,<...>|<comments or source of recipe>

Because the format of recipedata.txt is not particularly friendly to computers,
    it first undergoes conversion to recipedata.json. The format of that file is:
{
    <recipe name>: {
        "ingredients": {
            <ingredient name>: {
                "quantity": <quantity>,
                "qtype": <qtype>
            },
            <...>
        }
    },
    <...>
}
